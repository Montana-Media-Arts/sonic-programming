## COURSE OVERVIEW

In _Sonic Programming_ students will learn how to utilize computer science based techniques to create, process, and distribute original sonic art and music. This course will spend a majority of its time focused on the real-time creation of sonic art and music, as well as the application of concepts from interactive theory and interactive systems.

In a time with an increasing number of job opportunities that require individuals to be capable of not only creating custom content, but of creating custom content that is live with interactive opportunities, it is important that artists become capable of utilizing technologies that allow for this. There are many tools available to artists and musicians to create these types of music and artworks. Fortunately, the principles underlying most of these technologies are transferrable. Therefore, it is critical that artists and musicians deeply learn at least one of these environments or tools. The knowledge and skills developed in one are then transferrable to others. For that reason, we will primarily utilize the SuperCollider language and environment. This tool is chosen because it is open-source, cross-platform compatible, widely used, and incredibly powerful.

This course will involve weekly sketches and two larger compositions/artworks. These will be complimented with in-class lectures on technique, critical listening to ground your work, and discussions of aesthetics as it relates to this type of sonic art and music.
